## :hammer: Tools

<details>
<summary>:sparkles: Liquify Tools</summary>
as you know photoshop has many useful tools like `Liquify Tools`.</br>

if you get some errors during working with these tools
It may because of the graphics card.</br>

photoshop uses the `GPU` to process these tools so before using these tools make sure that your graphics card `(Nvidia, AMD)` is configured correctly in your Linux machine.
</br>The other solution is you can configure photoshop to use `CPU` for image processing. to do that, follow the below steps:

* go to edit tab and open `preferences` or `[ctrl+K]`
* then go to the `performance` tab
* in the graphics processor settings section, uncheck `Use graphics processor`
